# ABC-Stacking-for-Subglacial-Lakes
This project is a stacking ensemble learning system optimized by the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, specifically designed to automatically predict subglacial lakes (SLs) beneath the Antarctic ice sheet using radio-echo sounding (RES) data. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance under extremely imbalanced data conditions, significantly improving the detection capability of subglacial lakes. It has been successfully applied to the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica.

üìöProject Structure

Dataset - how to download the data
Feature exteaction - how to define features
Stacking model - how to use abc-stacking model 

üì¶ Installation

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost tqdm joblib

üìÇ Data Preparation

After download the dataset and use the make_feature.m
Ensure the following CSV files are placed in the training/ directory:
- dataset_ratio_1_to_***_0.csv ‚Äì Training dataset. 
- all_w_validation.csv ‚Äì Validation and test dataset.
  
CSV Column Requirements:
- Features: TFF, CBRP, Basal elevation, Hydraulic head gradient, Roughness
- Label: Label
Please create the training and validation datasets according to your specific needs or based on the data distribution described in my paper. 

üõ† Usage
python abc_stacking.py
This will:
1. Load the datasets.
2. Run ABC optimization to select the best stacking configuration.
3. Train the final stacking model.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set and output the F1 score.
5. Save the trained model as abc_stacking_model.pkl.
